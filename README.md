# Car Price Prediction Model
This project focuses on evaluating and comparing the performance of multiple machine learning regression algorithms using a dataset containing features of second-hand cars. 
The objective is not to deploy a predictive model, but to analyze how different algorithms perform on the same regression task under controlled conditions.

## Models Used
The following regression models were implemented and compared:

1) Linear Regression
2) Decision Tree Regressor
3) Random Forest Regressor
4) Gradient Boosting Regressor
5) K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor (KNN)
6) Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

# Key Findings
Gradient Boosting Regressor consistently outperformed the other models in both data splits with the highest RÂ² score and lowest errors.
Linear Regression also performed surprisingly well as a baseline model.
Support Vector Regressor and KNN showed significantly lower performance without tuning.
